# StructureSurfer
A tool for browsing RNA secondary structure information

Structure Surfer is a web tool for scientists who want to browse RNA secondary structure information from different labs. It's online here:

http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/structuresurfer

This repository contains the Python script that the webtool uses to browse the database. It also contains a MySQL dump describing the tables.

#### Creating The Database
The full Structure Surfur database is available as MySQL dump file at pennbox. No login is required.

https://upenn.app.box.com/s/1kj2f1w994sp3jmaakqhy9cw2w11vajk

You will need mySQL installed and a user account with the ability to GRANT SELECT priviledges. Run this command:
>mysql -p < structure_surfer.mysql

Alternately, you can create an empty Structure Surfur database for your own data with the MySQL dump file in this folder.

Both methods make a database with three tables:
>structure_score - RNA secondary structure scores with genomic coordinates

>structure_source - The experiments that generates the scores

>transcript - Exon coordinates for transcripts

#### Browsing The Database
structurePlotMaker.py is a tool for browsing the database. It can handle a few types of requests. It generates a table of results in plaintext and in xml as well as an xml plot.

###### Python requirements
pygal

MySQLdb


###### Get scores from all datasets using genomic coordinate
>python2.7 makeStructurePlot.py -c chr7 -s 45459777 -e 45459811 -g mm -pfx my_output_file

-s and -e The start and end coordinates

-c The chromosome

-g Specifies the genome: mm (mouse), hs (human) or at (thale cress)

-pfx The prefix for the three output files

###### Get average score of several regions using a bed file
In some cases it's useful to take several regions of interest and find the average score profile across them. 

>python2.7 makeStructurePlot.py -b my_input_file.bed -g mm -pfx my_output_file

-b The file name of a bed file containing the coordinates of interest. All bed intervals must be of the same size. 

###### Get scores from an annotated transcript
>python2.7 makeStructurePlot.py -t AT3G61897.1 -g at -pfx my_output_file

-t Transcript ID. This must be a transcript ID that exists in the transcript table
